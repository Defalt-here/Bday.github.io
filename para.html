        <h1 align = "center">My favourite reptile</h1>
        <p>To
            <br>
            my favourite reptile,
            <br>
            I had never ever thought that you'd be as close to me as you are now,
            frankly the first time I saw you I knew you were way outta my league. Being the pragmatic guy I
            am I didn't initiate conversation. Though when you came to me asking for
            those adobe products which you still haven't learnt I knew that you were at best exagerating how
            surprised you were by my skills or at worst faking it, it is because back then I only recently had a 
            similar experience.
            <br><br>
            Though it is a complete surprise to me that you infact, were not faking your interest, I was
            intrigued genuinely. That is when I knew I have a person who'll appreciate me for <b>who</b> I am and not <b>what</b> I am.
            Since then there haven't been a single day where I haven't flaunted our friendship to people around me and if I don't 
            find people around me I then flaunt it to my own past self!
            <br><br>
            You have come to be very precious to my life and endeavours in Pune and beyond. I may even say the most precious yet,
            but I will obviously not say it to your face because I have trouble showing affection (I'd rather code 7 pages of pure
            HTML CSS and JS than writing you a para and post a good story of yours) but know that it does not mean I don't feel for you.
            I do, lord knows I do, the heavens know I do.
            <br><br>
            I care for you and I do get protective too! I fear sometimes if I'll ever be enough for you if I'll ever be as good a friend
            as you are to me, I have my own doubts and fears about it but I try my best; even through everything I try my best. I'd rather
            leave LC than lose you (confidential statement) and I really don't know how to show that. I also don't know if I'll be at
            my fullest capacity when you'll need me. I know you can handle (most cases) on your own but alas I wouldn't want you to be alone
            at your best or at your worst.
            <br><br>
            You've been kinder to me claiming you're not than most have been harsh claiming they are kind. You have tended my wounds and
            tolerated me when I've become intolerable. I am grateful and indebted to your patience your kindness and your unending love.
            You taught me that I deserve to be happy. You taught me that I am not a mere project, you taught me to be human. 
            <br><br>
            When everyone clapped at my achievements and celebrated my victories, you asked me if I was alright. You loved me for being a human
            not a robot. For a world filled with LCs and LLM projects and internships you accepted me for simply being, <b>me</b>. There is not 
            a greater love that I know of(Rishi should really be jealous of me). I look up to you, with utmost respect and an even grander admiration
            and I will for the life of me never forget what you've become to me in such small a time. I wish to have someone with your wits and hearts 
            around me for the rest of my life (someone who's not a jain preferably) and it is in my heart that I tell you, I'll forever fight for you,
            and with you, up until the gods grow tired of our antics I then plan to fight god.
            <br><br>
            Forever yours<br>
            Aditya.
            <br><br>
            P.S.: Do not show this to anyone, I'll gouge your eyes out.
            <br><br>
